To celebrate the 2024 tax season in Canada, I am excited to unveil [Money Genie](https://salary.stefanovazzoler.com/#calculation), a versatile tool for estimating your net pay, alongside a [financial guide](https://github.com/stefanovazzocell/CanadianFinances/blob/main/README.md) to help you build wealth in the Canadian landscape. My aim is to contribute towards making financial knowledge and wealth-building accessible to all.

## [Canadian Finances](https://github.com/stefanovazzocell/CanadianFinances/blob/main/README.md)

Having lived in Canada for several years, I've gathered valuable insights on wealth-building strategies. Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned Canadian, the lessons I've learned can benefit you, especially in the current economic climate of soaring living costs.

As we navigate through early 2024, where the cost of living has surged, and not all salaries have kept pace, I believe sharing financial literacy can empower everyone to manage their finances better and boost their savings.

Money Genie is a powerful tool that calculates net pay after taxes and simulate the impact of various financial decisions on your savings and take-home pay.

This [open-source](https://github.com/stefanovazzocell/MoneyGenie) tool is freely available for use, prioritizing your privacy by performing all calculations directly on your browser without collecting any personal data.

The process involves estimating your gross salary, factoring in elements like base pay, bonuses, stock grants, RRSP matching, and EESP programs. It then applies relevant taxes and deductions (federal/provincial taxes and CPP/EI contributions) while considering tax credits (federal/provincial basic personal amount and the federal spousal/partner amount). This allows you to obtain a comprehensive net income estimate for the year, applicable across 12 provinces and for 2023 and 2024.

Money Genie goes beyond mere calculations, occasionally offering insightful tips on optimizing your tax bill and discovering potential savings.

It's important to note that both Money Genie and the Canadian Finances guide serve as starting points rather than formal financial advice.
