I've redesigned my personal site to look better, have even fast loading times,
and thanks to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) - a static site engine - easier to edit.

## Looking back

My personal site went through various designs always seeking faster speeds.

I started with a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site,
then switched to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) seeking better performance,
wishing for a super fast static site I redesigned the site to be simpler, smaller, and avoid any JavaScript.

The last iteration of this site was super performant, loading in under a second over 3G connections transferring around 17 KiB of data.

This search for faster speed has the welcomed bonus of making my website very privacy-friendly thanks to no JavaScript and zero external dependencies.

## Needing more

Although the speed was right, I was left craving for more.
Things as simple as adding a blog post required me to write custom HTML every time.
Furthermore the site didn't look great.

I thought about writing my own static site engine for a bit - and I might get back to this idea in the future - but that is time consuming and was not a high priority project for me.

After looking for a while without finding anything interesting I stumbled across [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) which is a simple static site generator that does just enough for what I need and not much more. It was perfect!

## Redesign

I'm not a graphic designer but I had fun redesigning my site and got to a point where I was satisfied.
I might tweak it more in the future as time passes but for now I'm happy with it.

**Zola** is able to compile it super fast (in under 10ms) and allows me to write and edit blog posts in markdown which makes me very happy.

## Future

I'm not sure what the future holds for this site, only time will tell.
I'd like to start writing more technical blogs, perhaps on Go (currently my go-to language for my projects).

All I can say now is... stay tuned!
